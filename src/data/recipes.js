After 1 hour, rinse the cabbage three times with water. If the cabbage is still too salty after rinsing, soak it in water for about 30 minutes to reduce the salty taste. For the seasoning, blend 1 onion, 200g garlic (adjustable), 25g ginger (optional), 100g water, 50g sugar, 1 tablespoon MSG, and 100g fish sauce to make a vegetable paste. Mix 3 tablespoons of flour and 200g water, microwave for 30 seconds, stir, and microwave for another 30 seconds to make a flour paste. Cut green onions into 1cm pieces, and chive into 3cm pieces. Mix 200g gochugaru, vegetable paste, flour paste, green onions, and chive. Adjust the seasoning with fish sauce if it’s not salty enough. Mix the seasoning paste with the soaked cabbage. Ferment at room temperature for 3-4 days and then store it in the refrigerator.",
